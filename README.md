# NodeGraph

General purpose Node Graph editor based on the source code of Unitys Shader Graph, but heavily stripped and modified. Basically only some of the GUI parts left of Shader Graph.

Also contains a multithreaded Behaviour Tree implementation, which uses a scheduler making it possible to step through each behaviour one at a time, and giving full control of leaf task execution.
